{"name":"TweetNET - v1.0","tagline":"Extensible, Easy to Use C# library for Twitter Integration","body":"# TweetNET v1.0\r\nby Zachary Kniebel\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n   TweetNET is a C# library for accessing the new Twitter API, v1.1. It is\r\n   light-weight, highly extensible, and includes classes designed for \r\n   explicit use with the different requests supported by twitter (e.g. \r\n   GET statuses/user_timeline, GET statuses/show/:id, etc.). The library\r\n   also satisfies the oAuth requirements for authorizing requests to \r\n   Twitter. The library matches up with Twitter's API, exactly, and all\r\n   request specific classes include, as properties, all of the query \r\n   parameters accepted by Twitter, for that request. The library's \r\n   intellisense for these properties is also copied directly from \r\n   Twitter's description and example values for that parameter, in their \r\n   API.\r\n   \r\n   \r\n## Using the Library\r\n   The initial release has included classes for two of Twitter's requests, \r\n   GET statuses/user_timeline and GET statuses/show/:id, (more are on the \r\n   way) along with the base Request class, which can be used to make any \r\n   request to Twitter. If you wish to use the Request class directly, you\r\n   will have to look up the request parameters that you need/want in the \r\n   request at http://dev.twitter.com/. You may also inherit the Request\r\n   class to build onto the library, using the inheriting classes for \r\n   the implemented request types as a guide. \r\n\r\n   \r\n## Making a request\r\n   Please view the Example_Request.txt document, for an example of how \r\n   you can make a simple request to retrieve a user's timeline. Note that\r\n   the Library matches up with Twitter's API, and request-specific classes\r\n   include, as properties, all of the query parameters accepted by \r\n   Twitter.\r\n   \r\n   \r\n## Rendering Tweets\r\n   TweetNET was originally designed to provide a C# back-end for Twitter\r\n   Feed, a jQuery plugin that is designed to simplify the rendering of \r\n   tweets. It was developed with simplicity, robustness, and performance\r\n   in mind, and may be used to render tweets regardless of the type of \r\n   request that was used to retrieve them. For more information, view the\r\n   repository at https://github.com/zkniebel/jquery-twitter-feed.\r\n\r\n   \r\n## More documentation for this library will be added as soon as possible.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
