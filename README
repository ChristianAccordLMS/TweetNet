# TweetNET v1.0
by Zachary Kniebel

## Overview
   TweetNET is a C# library for accessing the new Twitter API, v1.1. It is
   light-weight, highly extensible, and includes classes designed for 
   explicit use with the different requests supported by twitter (e.g. 
   GET statuses/user_timeline, GET statuses/show/:id, etc.). The library
   also satisfies the oAuth requirements for authorizing requests to 
   Twitter. The library matches up with Twitter's API, exactly, and all
   request specific classes include, as properties, all of the query 
   parameters accepted by Twitter, for that request. The library's 
   intellisense for these properties is also copied directly from 
   Twitter's description and example values for that parameter, in their 
   API.
   
   
## Using the Library
   The initial release has included classes for two of Twitter's requests, 
   GET statuses/user_timeline and GET statuses/show/:id, (more are on the 
   way) along with the base Request class, which can be used to make any 
   request to Twitter. If you wish to use the Request class directly, you
   will have to look up the request parameters that you need/want in the 
   request at http://dev.twitter.com/. You may also inherit the Request
   class to build onto the library, using the inheriting classes for 
   the implemented request types as a guide. 

   
## Making a request
   Please view the Example_Request.txt document, for an example of how 
   you can make a simple request to retrieve a user's timeline. Note that
   the Library matches up with Twitter's API, and request-specific classes
   include, as properties, all of the query parameters accepted by 
   Twitter.
   
   
## Rendering Tweets
   TweetNET was originally designed to provide a C# back-end for Twitter
   Feed, a jQuery plugin that is designed to simplify the rendering of 
   tweets. It was developed with simplicity, robustness, and performance
   in mind, and may be used to render tweets regardless of the type of 
   request that was used to retrieve them. For more information, view the
   repository at https://github.com/zkniebel/jquery-twitter-feed.

   
## More documentation for this library will be added as soon as possible.
